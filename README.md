# [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

The point of this project was to get better at using Typescript and React Hooks. I found that there are more efficient ways of using hooks.

### Technologies Used
---
- React
- Typescript


### Instructions on how to use the App
---
- Click around on the grid to fill the squares in any random pattern, or click the **Random** button below the grid.
- Click the start button to watch the simulation
- Once you are satisfied, click the clear button and watch it all over again.
